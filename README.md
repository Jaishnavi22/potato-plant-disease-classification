# Potato Plant Disease Classification

## Description
This project is a beginner-friendly image classification system that detects
whether a **potato plant leaf** is **Healthy** or **Diseased** using a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

The model is trained on potato leaf images and can also **predict the condition
of a new potato leaf image**.

---

## Key Tasks
- Collected potato leaf images (healthy and diseased)
- Organized the dataset into two classes
- Preprocessed images using TensorFlow
- Built a simple CNN model
- Trained the model on potato leaf images
- Predicted whether a given potato leaf image is healthy or diseased

---

## How It Works
- The CNN model learns patterns from healthy and diseased potato leaf images
- After training, a new leaf image (`test_leaf.jpg`) is given as input
- The model predicts whether the leaf is **Healthy** or **Diseased**

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
