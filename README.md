# Potato Plant Disease Classification

## Description
This project is a beginner-friendly image classification system that detects
whether a **potato plant leaf** is **Healthy** or **Diseased** using
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

The model is trained on potato leaf images and helps in understanding
basic plant disease detection using deep learning.

---

## Key Tasks
- Collected potato leaf images (healthy and diseased)
- Organized the dataset into two classes
- Preprocessed images using TensorFlow
- Built a simple CNN model
- Trained the model to classify leaf images
- Displayed classification accuracy during training

---

## Output
- The model classifies potato leaf images into:
  - **Healthy**
  - **Diseased**
- Training accuracy is displayed after each epoch
- Confirms successful plant disease classification using CNN

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
